/*
 * Sipho has a string s, of lower case English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.
 * Given an integer n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of Sipho's infinite string.
 * For example, if the string s = "abcac", and n = 10, the substring we consider is "abcacabcac", the first 10 characters of her infinite string.
 * There are 4 occurances of a in the substring.
 * 
 * The repeated string function has parameters: s, a string to repeat, and n, the number of characters to consider.
 * @INPUT FORMAT : 
 * 		The 1st line contains a single string s	
 * 			aba
 * 		The 2nd line contains an integer n
 * 			10
 * @CONSTRAINTS  :
 * 		1 <= |s| <= 100
 * 		1 <=  n  <= 10^12
 * 		For 25% of the test cases, n <= 10^6
 * @OUTPUT FORMAT:
 * 		Print a single integer denoting the number of letter a's in the 1st n letters of the infinite string created by repeating s infinitely many times
 * 			7
